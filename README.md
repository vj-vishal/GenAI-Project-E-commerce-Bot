# GenAI-Project-E-commerce-chatbot (project using LLama3.3 and GROQ)

This is POC of an intelligent chatbot tailored for an e-commerce platform, enabling seamless user interactions by accurately identifying the intent behind user queries. It leverages real-time access to the platform's database, allowing it to provide precise and up-to-date responses.

This project combines LLM Fine-Tuning, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and semantic intent classification to deliver fast, accurate, and human-like responses.

ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure:

- app/faq.py â†’ FAQ retrieval & RAG pipeline
- app/sql.py â†’ SQL generation & execution
- app/route.py â†’ Semantic intent routing
- app/small_talk.py â†’ Casual conversation handling
- app/main.py â†’ Streamlit chatbot interface

ðŸ“Š This chatbot currently supports two intents:

- **faq**: Triggered when users ask questions related to the platform's policies or general information. eg. Is online payment available?
- **sql**: Activated when users request product listings or information based on real-time database queries. eg. Show me all nike shoes below Rs. 3000.
- **Small Talk Mode**: Directly handled by the LLM for a human-like response
